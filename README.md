# Stone Tracker (Fresh Start)

The previous implementation has been intentionally cleared.

## Current state

- Minimal starter page
- Basic styling
- Reset confirmation button
- Service worker + manifest kept for simple PWA shell

## Run

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Open `http://localhost:8080`.
